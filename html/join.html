        <h3>Two Fully Funded PhD Positions at NC State in Geotechnical Engineering</h3>
   <p>         
We are seeking two self-motivated researchers <strong>starting January 2026</strong>. The research topics will focus on one of the following topics:
<ol>
    <li>
        Simulation of complex soil-structure interaction problems, such as root systems and bio-inspired foundation solutions using the Material Point Method (MPM)
    </li>
    <li>
        Discrete element modeling (DEM), constitutive modeling, and laboratory experimentation of rheological behavior of dry and saturated granular materials
    </li>
</ol>
<br>

<strong>These Ph.D. positions are fully funded</strong> by the National Science Foundation and North Carolina State University. The selected candidates will perform as either Graduate Research Assistants, Teaching Assistants, or a combination of both. The position covers tuition, stipends, and benefits for one year with the option of renewal contingent upon satisfactory performance. <br> <br>

We encourage applications from <strong>motivated and talented individuals with strong curiosity, quantitative and analytical skills, creative problem-solving abilities, and demonstrated experience in at least one programming language</strong> (Fortran and Python preferred). 
 <br> <br>

Qualified candidates interested in the position to join ZGEM should complete the form below by September 15. Candidates will be informed after September 20 about the selection process or until the positions are filled. <br> <br>

Please include the following attachments:
<ul>
    <li>Academic transcripts</li>
    <li>Updated CV</li>
    <li>Contact information for three academic references</li>
    <li>[Optional] an example of writing work (e.g., a peer-reviewed publication, M.S. thesis, etc.)</li>
    <li>[Optional] an example of coding work (e.g., a GitHub page)</li>
</ul>
 <br> 
If chosen, you will join North Carolina State University (NC State) and will be a member of the Wolf Pack. NC State has a top-ranked program in Civil Engineering and one of the most vibrant programs in Geotechnical Engineering, with faculty working on topics such as offshore foundation, scour, geotechnical earthquake engineering, advanced modeling of geosystems, and bio-inspired geotechnical engineering. You will be located in Raleigh in close proximity to the Research Triangle Park area, surrounded by the amenities of an urban space in one of the safest and most gorgeous places to live in the United States.
